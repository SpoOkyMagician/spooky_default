Title: Simplicity Theme


Author: SpoOkyMagician & StepMania Developers Team


Current Version: 2.5
Required Version: 5.1 Alpha or Newer


Description: A Theme for StepMania 5 Nightly Builds. The goal of my theme was to hide as much of the Metrics as I could and use Lua to create all the actors for the theme. The idea was to make it as simple as possible.
I am happy with the current results. Sadly, I cannot do much with online until the developers rewrite it. (If it ever gets done... :\ ) The theme itself may not appeal to many because how minimalistic the graphics are.
However, if you want a theme that get's the job done, feel free to use this. If you have any concerns, bug reports, etc, please contact me at jeremylevegood@gmail.com or post a bug report on my GitHub:

I would like to thank the SM5 Developers Team for putting up with me with my questions/frustrations/etc on the IRC... Especially Kyzentun. Doubt I would of finished this without him... Shoutout to Jousway as well.
(Shown me a better way to code my sorting icons.) Also, shout out to Prim and Leo for some assistance as well.

Here are a few screenshots you can view of the theme:
